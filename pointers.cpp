// POINTERS
// For C++, the memory of a PC is a succession of bytes,
// each with a unique memory address. 
// The exact memory address/es that are assigned to the program
// and it's variables is not decided BY the program,
// but instead usually by the OS.
//
// The actual address of a variable in memory cannot be known before runtime
